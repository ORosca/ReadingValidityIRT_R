# ReadingValidityIRT_R-
This repository contains an operational psychometrics project focused on the analysis of a diagnostic reading assessment data collected between May 2022 and May 2023 from two combined college samples. The primary goal was to evaluate 180 reading items using bifactor IRT models and to test the items for DIF across various demographic groups.
